# Reflection L3
## Chapter 2 - Names
I have tried to continue to be careful when giving the classes, variables and function names.

## Chapter 4 - Comments
JSDoc has been used as the standard for this project together with the linter from LNU. I have tried to not make the comments unnecessary but I do feel like the comments are a bit too obvious sometimes but because of the JSDoc I have followed the lint and therefore sometimes added comments which perhaps could be considered unnecessary or overkill.

## Summary
Overall this has been an interesting project, to develop both the module, refactor it and then create the app based on our own module. Personally I felt that it was difficult to implement everything I had wanted during the given time but at least I could manage to provide the basic functionality to simulate how I would want the app to work. 

Due to lack of time I chose to not implement and deploy the database, that is why some things are hardcoded.
