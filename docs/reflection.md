# Reflection L3
## Chapter 2 - Names
I have tried to continue to be careful when giving the classes, variables and function names.

## Chapter 3 - Functions


## Chapter 4 - Comments
JSDoc has been used as the standard for this project together with the linter from LNU. I have tried to not make the comments unnecessary but I do feel like the comments are a bit too obvious sometimes but because of the JSDoc I have followed the lint and therefore sometimes added comments which perhaps could be considered unnecessary or overkill.

## Summary
Overall this has been an interesting project, to develop both the module, refactor it and then create the app based on our own module. Personally I felt that it was difficult to implement everything I had wanted during the given time but at least I could manage to provide the basic functionality to simulate how I would want the app to work. 

Due to lack of time I chose to not implement and deploy the database, that is why some things are hardcoded.

I feel like there are a lot of improvements in my code but I struggled with the analyse and design of how to put together the classes. At first I created a spaghetti code, which was hard to untangle. I got lost in my own design after a while when trying to refactor it, and it got messy. Next time I want to follow the principles and standards from the book from the beginning so avoid breaking the code while refactoring.

Someting I have to take into consideration for future projects, is to spend more time on the design before coding to know how to decouple classes. Personally I struggle with keeping the cohesion high with low coupling. I noticed when I'm coding, way too often the code is coupled way too tight and one class is dependent of another class in a way which probably is incorrect. In severeal places I broke against the rule where we shoud not call a method directly on the return object.
